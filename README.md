# nflstats

## Description

statistical analysis of NFL players for fantasy football

right now the most useful script is draft_app.py, a command-line tool to interactively track players as a draft is occuring. It has a few metrics for evaluating draft value.

no instructions right now because if you're in my league and reading this I don't want to make it too easy for you (especially you, Russell).

## Requirements

nflgame (by BurntSushi)
 - although this requirement is being phased out as it lacks python3 support

pandas 0.22
seaborn (and its associated requirements: numpy, scipy, pandas, etc.)
retrying

in the future, a GUI w/ tk might be nice.
