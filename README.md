statistical analysis of NFL players for fantasy football (probably useless)

right now the most useful script is draft_projections.py, which allows one to interactively track players as a draft is occuring. It sorts by projected value over worst starter in that position, which is not optimal 

no instructions right now because if you're in my league and reading this I don't want to make it too easy for you (especially you, Russell).

Requirements:

nflgame (by BurntSushi)
seaborn (and its associated requirements: numpy, scipy, pandas, etc.)
  future:
Beautiful Soup (for scraping ESPN for the latest projections)
